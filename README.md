PloxWorld
=========

A sandbox space game. I have always been a sucker for simulations, and I hate when the AI cheats in sandbox games. So this is my take on games such as Elite or Space Ranger. You are competing with loads of AI players on equal premises. Can you rule the universe?

Current status
--------------

While parts of the simulation and player control is working, it is still far from a complete game.
The latest version can be played here: 83.248.110.56/PloxWorld/index.html

Why I did this
--------------

This is my serious attempt at getting good at AngularJS and Javascript. More then that though, it is a project that differs greatly from what I normally do at work. It is a real challenge, both in software engineering as well as mathematical modelling, and I hope to learn a great deal from it.
